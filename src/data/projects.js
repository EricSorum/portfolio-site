    description: `This simple top-scrolling shooter game shows the potential for AI to improve productivity. Using the Cursor AI integrated development environment (IDE) alongside the Claude Sonnet large language model (LLM), this project took only about three hours.\nWhile Cursor AI allowed for quick development, several roadblocks required me to debug and hand-code several features, such as the collision mechanic and enemy formations.\nOverall, I am excited by the prospect of delivering applications quicker, while appreciating the need to understand each line of code when working with AI.`
